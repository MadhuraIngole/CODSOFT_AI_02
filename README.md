# CODSOFT_AI_02
# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, where a player competes against an AI opponent. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three marks (either 'X' or 'O').

## Features
- Allows the player to make moves by selecting a cell on the board.
- Implements a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for the AI opponent, ensuring it plays optimally.
- Checks for a winner after each move and declares the winner if one exists.
- Declares a draw if the board is full and no winner is found.
- Prevents the player from selecting a cell that is already occupied.

## Usage
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. When prompted, select a cell to make your move by entering a number from 0 to 8.
3. The AI opponent will make its move automatically.
4. Continue making moves until a winner is determined or the game ends in a draw.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Note
This implementation provides a basic version of Tic Tac Toe with a simple command-line interface. It can be further enhanced by adding features such as:
- Graphical interface using a library like Tkinter or Pygame.
- Implementing different difficulty levels for the AI.
- Adding options for multiplayer mode.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this code to create your own version of Tic Tac Toe!
